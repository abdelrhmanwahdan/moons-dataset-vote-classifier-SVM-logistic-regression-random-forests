# moons dataset vote classifier using: SVM, logistic regression, random forests
in this project I am analyzing cleaning and visualizing the moons dataset then after that I am doing classification on it using vote classifier by the following steps:
1. Data wrangling (Data gathering , Data assessing , Data cleaning).
2. Exploratory Data Analysis.
3. using vote classifier with different algorithms (SVM , logistic regression , random forests ) on moons dataset.
